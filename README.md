# R-Personal-Project

This is a personal project I undertook which seeks to examine the relationship between political affiliation and income. 

The technical tools I used for this project were simply Rstudio (primarily ggplot2) in additon to basic descriptive statistics and data visualization.  


## Important Information:
The data I used comes from the Pew Research April '17 political survey.

To see the specific variables used and how they were coded please reference the linked PDF. 

To see the specific code used to create the graphs and tables please reference the linked Rscript.
